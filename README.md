BulletML
This is an Android port of the BulletML demo from Kenta Cho. BulletML is the Bullet Markup Language. BulletML can describe the barrage of bullets in shooting games. The original demo is here http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/index_e.html. This version draws to Canvas. The line width and rank are configurable. Dragging your finger around the screen pulls a virtual 'spaceship' along which causes 'frags' to be spun off when the bullets hit the point. Now with OpenGL renderer..
