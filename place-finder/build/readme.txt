In order to use the demo you will have to generate a map key.

You can find out how this is done here:

http://code.google.com/android/toolbox/apis/mapkey.html

I have provided a batch file which will fetch the debug MD5 fingerprint it is called 'getDebugKey.bat'

1) Setup the path to your debug keystore in 'definitions.bat'

2) From a command prompt run 'getDebugKey.bat' 

3) Submit this fingerprint here

4) Take the map api key and put it into main.xml android:apiKey property for the mapView.

These instructions are not meant to be an exhaustive guide. There is plenty of help on how to this
on the links I have provided. I will not be answering any questions on this stuff.
